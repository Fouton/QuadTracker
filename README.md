# QuadTracker
Standalone Quad Tracker in a similar style to Sushi's Entrando Tracker for Z3


**For now the code will stay hidden until it is at its released state.**


## Planned Features:
- Z1: Drag & Dropping onto dungeon maps
- Z3: Dungeon Counters
- SM: Local Area Maps
- Mousing over Icons give info (Check/Entrance name, Full Dungeon info)

## Potential Features:
- M1 & SM: Logic for all checks
- Z1 & Z3: Logic for Non ER checks

## Eventuals if Quad Rando includes them:
- Z1 Dungeon Room Rando or whatever its called auto map making
- Z3 Door Rando (The Nothing Yet tab) & Region Hint Counters
- SM Map Rando map maker (probably needs autotracking to be possible)
- All Boss Prize Shuffling (already built into Z3/SM)

## Autotracking (Eventually) plans:

### Z1:
- Highlight what Overworld or Underworld Tile youre on
- Auto build dungeon maps when feature implemented
- Auto mark entrances with correct identifier as theyre found

### M1:
- Potentially Show location or room for ease of map reading

### Z3:
- Auto mark entrances with correct identifier as theyre found
- Muffins Jank Door Tracker as we know it

### SM:
- SM Map Rando automatically crafting maps as rooms are explored
